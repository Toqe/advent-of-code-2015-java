# Advent of Code 2015

Just my thoughts on solving Advent of Code 2015 in Java / Kotlin.

See https://adventofcode.com/2015 for the puzzle descriptions.

I tried to do it with intuitive approaches and without going too deep into math and complex algorithms. My focus was on having fun, not producing production grade code :grin:

I hadn't used Java for quite some time and it was fun exploring it after some time - but also reminded me why I use C# on a day to day basis :sweat_smile:
Kotlin was a new language for me, but it's easy to learn and really a great Java replacement on the JVM. I liked it a lot despite its syntax being a bit further away from my preferred C/C# style.

My inputs are not included (for reference see https://adventofcode.com/about -> `If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs.`)
